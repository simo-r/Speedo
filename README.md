# Speedo
Simple Android application developed for an university exam. It receives user's location info and it also implements Wi Fi P2p sharing.
# NB
This app just shows how to use Android components and frameworks <b>just for learning purpose</b>. It could have lots of bugs and wrong locations information. Code is fully documented <p> but </p> just in Italian (exam purpose).
